    content: `
      Traditional CCTV cameras only record video. Security teams usually review footage after an incident has already happened.
      
      AI computer vision changes this. By running AI vision models on local edge hardware like NVIDIA Jetson, your cameras process video streams in real time.
      
      Intrusions and boundary breaches are detected instantly, alerting your security team before issues escalate. Because processing happens on-site, your video data remains completely private.
